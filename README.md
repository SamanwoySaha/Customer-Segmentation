### 1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**

- Data quality assessment and cleaning
- Missing value treatment
- Feature engineering and selection

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Statistical summary of customer data
- Distribution analysis of key features
- Correlation analysis between variables
- Visualization of customer patterns

### 3. **Feature Engineering**

- Customer lifetime value calculation
- Standardization and scaling

### 4. **Clustering Analysis**

- **K-Means Clustering**: Primary segmentation method
- **Elbow Method**: Optimal cluster determination

## 📈 Visualizations

The notebook includes comprehensive visualizations:

- Customer distribution across segments
- Age Distribution
- Income Distribution
- Total Spending Distribution
- Income by Education Level
- Spending by Marital Status
- Correlation Matrix (Income, Age, Recency, Total Spending, Number of Web Purchases, Number of Store Purchases)
- Heatmap (Average Income by Education and Marital Status)
- Average Spending by Education
- Campaign Acceptance Rate by Marital Status
- Average Income by Age Group
- ELbow Method for Optimal Cluster Size
- Customer Segmentation (PCA)


### Customer Segments: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Identify Customer Segments**: Group customers with similar characteristics and behaviors
